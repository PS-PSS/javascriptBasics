General Goal: Learn Javascript with the homies

Specific Goal: Figure out what level everyone is at first

Hi All,

Let's start with this activity, pulled from one of the lesson plans I have access to as a TA at UCI's coding bootcamp:

Instructions:

Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.

If they respond with "yes", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Steak Sandwich!"

If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!"

BONUS: Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: "No Sake for you!"

HINT: You will need to use document.write()


This should be a good starter activity to see where everyone's at with variables, conditionals, etc. Nothing too fancy, but we could break it down next time we meet.
